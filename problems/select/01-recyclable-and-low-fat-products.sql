-- Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50]
-- Difficulty: [easy]
-- Approach: filter the Products table for rows where both low_fats and recyclable columns have the value 'Y'. Then select and return the product_id for these products.

SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
